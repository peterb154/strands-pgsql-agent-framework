# deploy.sh — runs on the LXC HOST, not inside the container.
#
# Triggered by <agent>-deploy.service (installed by bootstrap-lxc.sh),
# which is in turn triggered by <agent>-deploy.path watching
# .deploy-trigger. The agent container's /api/deploy endpoint (enabled
# via `make_app(deploy=True)`) writes to that trigger file; this script
# handles the git pull + rebuild on the host.
#
# Because this runs on the host, it's not killed when docker recreates
# the agent container — that's the whole reason for the architecture.
